    <h2>
        This is from Static HTML About Page
    </h2>

    <h3>Note: </h3>
    <p>
        Even though we have app.get('/') Its redirected to index.html because /index.html is same as / So it overriden from app.js
    </p>
    <p>
        But in case of about its about it's different. <br> 1. If we just add about is will redirect to route which is specified in app.js file insted to about.html page <br> 2. If we specify about.html in url the only it will redirect to about.html page.
        This is because about.html is not a default one as index.html
    </p>
